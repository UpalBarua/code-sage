    "question": "what is cors?",
    "answer": "CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It is a browser security feature that restricts cross-origin HTTP requests. When the client and server have a different origin from each other, trying to make a request to a resource on the other server will fail. This is a security concern for the browser. CORS disables this mechanism and allow access to these resources. It will add a response header access-control-allow-origins and specify which origins are permitted. CORS ensures that we are sending the right headers."

    "question": "How does the private route work?",
    "answer": "Private Routes/Protected Routes in React Router require a user being authorized to visit a route. So if a user is not authorized for a specific page, they cannot access it. The react private route component renders child components if the user is logged in. If not logged in the user is redirected to the /login page with the return url passed in the location state property. The current logged in user (authUser) is retrieved from context."

    "question": "What is Node? How does Node work?",
    "answer": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chromeâ€™s V8 JavaScript engine it uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. Node.js runs a single-threaded event loop registered with the system to handle connections, and each new connection causes a JavaScript callback function to fire. The callback function can handle requests with I/O calls, and if necessary can spawn threads from a pool to execute blocking or CPU-intensive operations and to load-balance across CPU cores. Node also has a large ecosystem. The NPM registry hosts more than 1.3 million packages of free, reusable Node.js code, which makes it the largest software registry in the world."
